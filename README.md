## Enigma Machine

A simplified form of the World War II German encryption machines know as 
[Engima machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine). 
There is no plug board or rotor rings. It is the basis for the modern and 
well known encryption algorithm known as DES (Data Encryption Standard) 
and is also a part of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). It is a symmetric cipher
which assisted in its attack. [Alan Turning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) 
devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers.
