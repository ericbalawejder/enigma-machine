THE BREAKING OF ENIGMA BY THE POLISH MATHEMATICIANS

AS GERMAN MILITARY POWER INCREASED DURING THE 1920'S, THE POLES FELT
THREATENED AND VULNERABLE, SITUATED AS THEY WERE BETWEEN TWO POWERFUL
NATIONS, GERMANY TO THE WEST AND RUSSIA TO THE EAST.  IN ORDER TO DISCOVER
THE INTENTIONS OF THEIR POTENTIAL ENEMIES, THEY RESORTED TO INTELLIGENCE
GATHERING. THEY HAD A LONG TRADITION OF THIS AND PARTICULARLY OF CODE
BREAKING.

THE MODERN USE OF RADIO ALLOWED THEM TO INTERCEPT ENEMY RADIO TRANSMISSIONS
WITHOUT REVEALING THEIR INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.  FROM 1928 ONWARD POLISH
INTELLIGENCE INTERCEPTED GERMAN RADIO TRANSMISSIONS USING A NEW CIPHER
SYSTEM WHICH WAS EVENTUALLY IDENTIFIED AS COMING FROM AN ENIGMA MACHINE.
POLISH INTELLIGENCE HAD OBTAINED EXAMPLES OF THE COMMERCIAL ENIGMA MACHINE
BUT QUICKLY FOUND THAT THE GERMAN ENIGMA WAS DIFFERENT IN DETAIL FROM THE
COMMERCIAL VERSION.

THE POLISH MATHEMATICIANS POLISH INTELLIGENCE WERE INITIALLY UNABLE TO
BREAK THE GERMAN ENIGMA TRAFFIC, HOWEVER DRIVEN BY THE IMPERATIVE OF
FINDING WHAT THE GERMANS WERE UP TO, THEY, UNIQUELY AMONG OTHER NATIONS AT
THAT TIME, DECIDED TO TRY A MATHEMATICAL APPROACH. IN 1932 A TEAM OF YOUNG
MATHEMATICIANS WAS SET UP. IT INCLUDED JERZY ROZYCKI, HENRYK ZYGALSKI AND
MARIAN REJEWSKI (ALL OF WHOM WERE PRODUCTS OF THE NOTABLE FLOWERING OF
POLISH MATHEMATICS IN THE 1920S AND 1930S).  REJEWSKI QUICKLY SHOWED THAT
MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES COULD BE USED TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM OF FINDING THE
MESSAGE KEY BY EXPLOITING THE GERMAN'S CRYPTOGRAPHIC ERROR IN REPEATING THE
MESSAGE KEY AT THE START OF A TRANSMISSION.

THE PROBLEM THAT STILL HAD TO SOLVED WAS THE INTERNAL WIRING CONNECTIONS IN
EACH WHEEL. IN THIS POLISH INTELLIGENCE WERE HELPED BY THE FRENCH. THE
FRENCH WERE VERY INTERESTED IN ASSISTING POLAND BECAUSE THEY ALSO WERE
DISTURBED BY THE RISE IN GERMAN MILITANCY AND WANTED AN ALLY ON GERMANS
EASTERN FLANK.

IN 1931 AND 1932 THE FRENCH CRYPTOGRAPHER GUSTAVE BERTRAND OBTAINED
PRICELESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE GERMAN ENIGMA FROM A SPY, HANS-THILO
SCHMIDT, KNOWN BY THE CODE NAME ASCHE. THE FRENCH WERE UNABLE TO USE THIS
INFORMATION TO BREAK INTO THE GERMAN ENIGMA TRAFFIC. IT WAS ALSO PASSED TO
THE BRITISH WHO WERE ALSO AT THIS TIME UNABLE TO BREAK INTO ENIGMA. FINALLY
BERTRAND PASSED THE INFORMATION TO POLISH INTELLIGENCE WHO HAD NOT REVEALED
HOW FAR THEY HAD GOT WITH THEIR ATTACK ON ENIGMA. THIS INFORMATION, WHICH
INCLUDED GERMAN OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS FOR ENIGMA AND TWO SHEETS OF MONTHLY
KEY SETTINGS ENABLED REJEWSKI TO DEDUCE THE INTERNAL WHEEL WIRING FOR ALL
THREE WHEELS, BUT ONLY AFTER HE HAD MADE AN INSPIRED LEAP OF
IMAGINATION. THE PROBLEM WAS THE ORDER OF THE 26 WIRES CONNECTING THE
KEYBOARD TO THE FIXED ENTRY DISC AT THE RIGHT HAND END OF THE THREE WHEELS.

IN THE COMMERCIAL ENIGMA, WHICH THE POLISH TEAM POSSESSED, THE WIRING ORDER
CLOCKWISE ROUND THE ENTRY DISC WAS THE ORDER OF THE KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD,
QWERTZUIO... REJEWSKI HAD REALISED THAT THE WIRING ORDER MUST BE DIFFERENT
ON THE GERMAN FORCES ENIGMA, BUT HAD NO WAY OF FINDING OUT WHAT THE ORDER
WAS. THE INSPIRED LEAP OF IMAGINATION WAS TO SUPPOSE THE GERMANS HAD, IN
THEIR LOGICAL WAY, JUST USED ABCDEFG... AS THE ORDER. HE TRIED THIS AND IT
WORKED AND HE COULD NOW WORK OUT FROM HIS EQUATIONS THE INTERNAL WIRING OF
THE THREE WHEELS AND THE REFLECTOR.

THE DEDUCTION OF THE INTERNAL WIRING OF THE WHEELS WAS A SPECTACULAR FEAT
BY REJEWSKI. IT ENABLED THE POLISH CRYPTOGRAPHERS TO BUILD REPLICAS OF THE
GERMAN ENIGMA MACHINE WHICH COULD THEN BE USED TO DECIPHER THE INTERCEPTED
RADIO MESSAGES ONCE THE ENIGMA CONFIGURATION AND THE MESSAGE SETTINGS HAD
BEEN DEDUCED.  THAT WAS THE NEXT PROBLEM. REJEWSKI HAD SHOWN THAT HIS
"CHARACTERISTICS" COULD BE DEDUCED FROM A DAY'S RADIO TRAFFIC WHEN THE
GERMANS WERE DOUBLE ENCIPHERING THE ENIGMA MESSAGE SETTINGS. NOW THE POLISH
CRYPTOGRAPHERS HAD TO PRODUCE A CATALOGUE OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS FOR
EVERY WHEEL ORDER AND EVERY WHEEL START POSITION, 26X26X26X6 ENTRIES,(NO
LESS THAN 105,456 IN ALL!), IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THE ENIGMA CONFIGURATION FOR
THAT DAY.

THEY DEVISED A MACHINE WHICH THEY CALLED A CYCLOMETER. THIS CONSISTED OF,
IN EFFECT, TWO ENIGMA MACHINES SIDE BY SIDE WITH THEIR RIGHT HAND WHEELS
OFFSET BY THREE PLACES.  THEN IN SEPTEMBER 1938 THE GERMANS CHANGED THE
ENIGMA PROCEDURES FOR ENCIPHERING MESSAGE KEYS. THEY NO LONGER STARTED THE
MESSAGE KEY ENCIPHERMENT FROM ONE STANDARD SET OF WHEEL POSITIONS SET FOR
THE WHOLE 24 HOUR PERIOD, BUT ASKED THE ENIGMA OPERATOR TO CHOOSE A
DIFFERENT ENCIPHERMENT START, KNOWN AS THE INDICATOR, FOR EACH MESSAGE SENT
AND TO TRANSMIT THE CHOSEN INDICATOR WITH THE DOUBLE ENCIPHERED MESSAGE
SETTING IN THE HEADER OF THE GERMAN MESSAGE.

THIS MEANT THAT REJEWSKI'S CHARACTERISTICS NO LONGER WORKED BECAUSE THEY
DEPENDED ON ALL MESSAGE KEY ENCIPHERMENTS BEING FROM THE SAME WHEELS START
POSITIONS.  WHEN THEY HAD BEEN STUDYING THE DOUBLE ENCIPHERED MESSAGE
SETTINGS IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT REJEWSKI'S CHARACTERISTICS, CASES HAD BEEN
NOTICED WHERE THE SAME ENCIPHERED LETTER OCCURRED IN EITHER THE 1ST AND
4TH, OR 2ND AND 5TH, OR 3RD AND 6TH POSITIONS IN THE ENCIPHERED MESSAGE
SETTINGS. THESE POSITIONS, WHICH WERE CALLED FEMALES, CORRESPONDED TO
POSITIONS AT WHICH THE SAME LETTER HAD BEEN KEYED BY THE GERMAN OPERATOR
INTO THE ENIGMA MACHINE BECAUSE OF THE REPEAT OF THE THREE LETTER MESSAGE
KEY.  ZYGALSKI REALISED THAT WHETHER THIS OCCURRED OR NOT DEPENDED ON THE
WHEEL ORDER AND THE START POSITION, THEREFORE INVERSELY IF IT DID OCCUR IT
IMPLIED ONE OF A SET OF POSSIBLE ENIGMA CONFIGURATIONS. IF ENOUGH OF THESE
DOUBLES OCCURRED DURING A DAYS TRAFFIC IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO FIND A
UNIQUE CONFIGURATION FOR WHICH ALL OF THESE DOUBLES COULD OCCUR.

THE SETTINGS OF THE ENIGMA WERE: WHEELS 132 RINGS QJF AND NO STECKERS. THE
LIST OF 234 INTERCEPTS CONTAINS 34 FEMALES OF WHICH 14 ARE OF THE 1,4 TYPE.
ZYGALSKI REALISED THAT THE ANALYSIS OF THE VAST AMOUNT OF INFORMATION
REQUIRED COULD BE ACHIEVED BY A GRILL METHOD USING PERFORATED SHEETS.  THE
SHEET PROCEDURE INVOLVES WORKING THROUGH EACH OF THE SIX POSSIBLE WHEEL
ORDERINGS FOR THREE WHEELS AND FOR EACH WHEEL ORDER WORKING THROUGH THE 26
POSSIBLE LEFT HAND WHEEL RING LETTERS, 156 TRIES IN ALL, BUT ON AVERAGE
ONLY HALF BEFORE THE ANSWER IS FOUND.  THERE WERE SHEETS PREPARED FOR EACH
LEFT WHEEL LETTER FOR EACH WHEEL ORDER. EACH SHEET CONTAINED FOUR SQUARES
OF 26 BY 26 IE TWO ALPHABETS ALONG THE TOP AND DOWN THE SIDE.

THE FIRST DECISION WAS WHICH WHEEL ORDER TO TRY, (IN OUR CASE 132) AND
WHICH RING FIRST LETTER, IN THIS CASE Q. NEXT TAKE THE FIRST LETTER OF THE
FIRST INDICATOR THAT GIVES A 1,4 FEMALE IN THIS CASE P AND GET THE SHEET
123 Q P. PLACE THIS ON THE TABLE OFFSET BY THE NEXT TWO LETTERS OF THE
INDICATOR, TJ. NOW GET SHEETS FOR SUCCEEDING INDICATORS OVERLAYING THEM ON
THE TABLE. IF THE WHEEL ORDER AND THE FIRST RING LETTER ARE WHAT WAS USED
TO ENCIPHER THE MESSAGE KEY THEN ONE SQUARE WILL LINE UP AND LET LIGHT
THROUGH FROM BELOW THE TABLE. THE ORIGINAL RING SETTING CAN NOW BE DEDUCED
FROM THE CO-ORDINATES OF THIS LIT SQUARE.

REJEWSKI'S BOMBA REJEWSKI ALSO HAD THE IDEA FOR A MECHANICAL METHOD FOR
FINDING THE ENIGMA RING SETTINGS FROM THE FEMALES IN THE DOUBLE ENCIPHERED
MESSAGE SETTINGS.  THIS WAS CALLED THE BOMBA. LONG AFTER WW II REJEWSKI
DREW A SKETCH OF IT. THE IDEA WAS TO ROTATE SIX SETS OF ENIGMA WHEELS IN
SYNCHRONISM WITH EACH SET BEING ONE FAST WHEEL POSITION IN ADVANCE OF THE
PRECEDING ONE SO THAT THE SIX POSITIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE DOUBLE
ENCIPHERMENT OF THE MESSAGE SETTING COULD BE EXAMINED SIMULTANEOUSLY
LOOKING FOR REPEATING ENCIPHERED LETTERS.  SIX OF THESE MACHINES WERE
REQUIRED, EACH SET WITH ONE OF THE SIX POSSIBLE WHEEL ORDER FOR THE
POSSIBLE THREE WHEELS IN THE ENIGMA MACHINE. THE BOMBAS WERE NOT VERY
RELIABLE AND ZYGALSKI'S SHEETS PRODUCED BETTER RESULTS.

IN INTERVIEWS AFTER THE WAR, REJEWSKI WAS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE BOMBAS WERE
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO ATTACK THE DOUBLE ENCIPHERMENT OF THE MESSAGE
SETTING. THEY WERE NOT DESIGNED, OR EVER USED, FOR A GENERAL "KNOWN TEXT"
ATTACK.  SUCCESSES, FAILURE AND A PRICELESS GIFT USING THESE TECHNIQUES THE
POLISH CRYPTOGRAPHERS WERE, BY 1938, READING SOME 75% OF INTERCEPTED GERMAN
RADIO TRANSMISSIONS ENCIPHERED USING THE ENIGMA MACHINE. THEY KEPT THIS A
VERY CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET, TELLING NO ONE OF THEIR SUCCESSES.

THEN IN 1938 THE GERMANS BROUGHT ANOTHER TWO WHEELS INTO SERVICE SO THAT
THE GERMAN OPERATOR NOW HAD TO CHOSE THREE OUT OF FIVE TO PUT INTO THE
ENIGMA MACHINE. THIS RAISED THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT REQUIRED TO FIND KEYS WAY
BEYOND WHAT POLISH INTELLIGENCE COULD PROVIDE.  IN JULY 1939 WITH THE
INVASION OF POLAND IMMINENT, THE POLISH CRYPTOGRAPHERS DECIDED TO SHARE
THEIR ENIGMA RESULTS WITH THE FRENCH AND BRITISH CODE BREAKERS. AT A
MEETING IN THE KABACKIE WOODS NEAR PYRY JUST OUTSIDE WARSAW ALL WAS
REVEALED TO THE UTTER ASTONISHMENT OF THE FRENCH AND BRITISH. THE POLISH
TEAM GAVE THEM COPIES OF THE GERMAN ENIGMA MACHINE AND REVEALED THE DETAILS
OF THE CYCLOMETERS, BOMBAS AND ZYGALSKI SHEETS.

JUST BEFORE THE GERMAN INVASION, THE THREE POLISH CODE BREAKERS ESCAPED
THROUGH ROUMANIA AND EVENTUALY JOINED UP WITH GUSTAVE BERTRAND AND HIS
FRENCH TEAM AT CHATEAU VIGNOLLES IN FRANCE JUST OUTSIDE PARIS.
